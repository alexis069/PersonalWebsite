My favorite hobbie is going to parks and spending time with my family. I like to spend time with my family and go to the park because I like the nauture how the water cools you out if you have any problems. I feel nauture is a way to let my stressfulness and just enjoy the breeze of the air and let my bad feelings go out. The park I go to is  the Marina in San Leandro.The park is not just to play its to enjoy with my family too because I dont spend time a lot with them.</p>
